    <h1>Garlicky Kale Salad with Crispy Chickpeas</h1>
    <img src="../images-and-links/garlicky-kale-salad-with-spiced-chickpeas.jpg" alt="A plate of garlicky kale salad with spiced chickpeas">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Even if you’re not a big spicy food lover, you’ll love this 
        salad. Think more smokiness and depth of flavor rather than 
        heat. Not to mention, the subtle sweetness of the dressing 
        brings balance so it’s not overwhelming.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large bundle kale (loosely chopped or torn)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chickpeas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 15-ounce can chickpeas</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp olive, avocado, or grape seed oil</li>
        <li>1 healthy pinch sea salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 - 3 Tbsp tandoori masala spice blend* (see notes 
            for DIY blend)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dressing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head garlic (large/even-sized cloves work best)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup tahini</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil + more for roasting garlic and massaging 
            kale</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice (plus more for massaging kale 
            // ~2 small lemons)</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tsp sesame seed oil</li>
        <li>1 healthy pinch each salt + pepper</li>
        <li>Hot water (to thin)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel apart garlic cloves but leave the skin on. Avoid using 
            any tiny garlic cloves from the center of the head. Preheat 
            oven to 375 degrees F (190 C).</li>
        <li>Add drained chickpeas to a mixing bowl and toss with oil, 
            salt, and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Add garlic cloves and seasoned chickpeas to a baking sheet. 
            Drizzle garlic with a bit of olive or grape seed oil. Bake 
            for 15-20 minutes (depending on the size of the garlic 
            cloves), or until garlic is fragrant and slightly browned. 
            Carefully remove garlic and set aside. Continue baking 
            chickpeas for 10-15 minutes more or until slightly crispy 
            and golden brown. Remove from oven and set aside (the 
            chickpeas will get more crispy as they cool).</li>
        <li>Squeeze garlic out of skins / peel away skins and add to a 
            mixing bowl. Add all remaining dressing ingredients and 
            whisk vigorously to combine, smashing the garlic with the 
            whisk. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired, adding more 
            lemon for brightness, tahini for richness, and maple syrup 
            for sweetness. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add kale to a large mixing bowl. Before adding dressing, 
            add 1 Tbsp each lemon juice and olive oil (amount as 
            original recipe is written // alter if adjusting batch 
            size) to the kale and massage with hands to soften the 
            texture and lessen bitterness. Then add as much dressing 
            as desired (some may be leftover) and mix with a spoon or 
            salad tongs.</li>
        <li>Top with chickpeas and serve. Best when fresh, though 
            leftovers keep in the fridge for up to a few days.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>*I bought my Tandoori Masala Spice blend at Whole Foods (it’s 
        the Whole Foods Market brand), but you can easily make your 
        own (see next note).</p>
    <p>*DIY Tandoori Masala Blend: 3 Tbsp cumin, 2 Tbsp garlic powder, 
        2 Tbsp paprika, 3 tsp ginger, 2 tsp coriander, 2 tsp cardamom. 
        Multiply as needed.</p>
